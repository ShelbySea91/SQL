What I did here was select all the customers who are not in the US:

SELECT LastName, Firstname, Email, Country
FROM chinook.customers
WHERE Country <> "USA";

What I did here was select only customers who live in Brazil:

SELECT *
FROM chinook.customers
WHERE Country = "Brazil";

Here I joined two tables to get the Invoices of customers who are from Brazil. The resulting table shows the customer's full name, Invoice ID, Date of the invoice, and billing country.

SELECT C.LastName, C.FirstName, I.InvoiceID, I.InvoiceDate, I.BillingCountry
FROM chinook.invoices I
LEFT JOIN chinook.customers C 
ON C.CustomerID = I.CustomerID
WHERE I.BillingCountry="Brazil";


Here I am showing the Employees who are Sales Agents:

SELECT EmployeeID, LastName, FirstName
FROM chinook.employees
WHERE Title="Sales Support Agent";


Here I used distinct to list the billing countries while also showing the total they spent from the Invoice table

SELECT DISTINCT BillingCountry, Total
FROM chinook.invoices;

Here I wrote a query that shows the invoices associated with each sales agent. I had to join three different tables in the same database to get this result.

SELECT emp.LastName, emp.Firstname, inv.InvoiceId
FROM chinook.Employees emp 
JOIN chinook.Customers cust 
ON cust.SupportRepId = emp.EmployeeId
JOIN chinook.Invoices Inv 
ON Inv.CustomerId = cust.CustomerId;

Here I wrote a query to show the Invoice Total, Customer name, Country, and Sales Agent name for all invoices and customers:

SELECT emp.LastName, emp.Firstname, cust.FirstName, cust.LastName, cust.Country, inv.total
FROM  chinook.customers cust
JOIN chinook.employees emp
ON cust.SupportRepID = emp.EmployeeID
JOIN chinook.Invoices inv
ON inv.CustomerID = cust.CustomerID;


Here I am showing how many Invoices there were there in 2009:

SELECT COUNT(InvoiceId) AS Invoices_In_2009   
FROM chinook.invoices
WHERE InvoiceDate LIKE '2009%';


SELECT COUNT(*) AS Invoices_in_2009
FROM chinook.Invoices
WHERE InvoiceDate BETWEEN '2009-01-01' AND '2009-12-31';


Here are the total sales for 2009:

SELECT SUM(Total)
FROM chinook.invoices
WHERE InvoiceDate LIKE '2009%'

SELECT SUM(Total)
FROM chinook.Invoices
WHERE InvoiceDate BETWEEN '2009-01-01' AND '2009-12-31';


Here I wrote a query that includes the purchased track name with each invoice line ID

SELECT t.Name, i.InvoiceLineId
FROM chinook.Invoice_items i
JOIN chinook.Tracks t 
ON i.TrackId = t.TrackId;


Here I wrote a query that includes the purchased track name AND artist name with each invoice line ID.

SELECT ar.Name as Artist, t.Name as Track, i.InvoiceLineID
FROM chinook.Invoice_items i
LEFT JOIN chinook.tracks t 
ON i.TrackID=t.TrackID
INNER JOIN chinook.albums a
ON a.AlbumID=t.AlbumID
LEFT JOIN chinook.artists ar
ON ar.ArtistID=a.ArtistID;


Here I wrote a query that shows all the Tracks, and include the Album name, Media type, and Genre.

SELECT t.Name, a.Title, m.Name, g.Name
FROM tracks t
JOIN albums a
ON t.AlbumId = a.AlbumId
JOIN media_types m
ON m.MediaTypeId = t.MediaTypeId
JOIN genres g
ON g.GenreId = t.GenreId;


Here I am showing the total sales made by each sales agent.

SELECT emp.FirstName, emp.LastName,
ROUND(SUM(Inv.Total), 2) as 'Total Sales' 
FROM chinook.Employees emp
JOIN chinook.Customers cust 
ON cust.SupportRepId = emp.EmployeeId
JOIN chinook.Invoices Inv 
ON Inv.CustomerId = cust.CustomerId
WHERE emp.Title = 'Sales Support Agent' 
GROUP BY emp.FirstName;


Here I am showing which sales agent made the most dollars in sales in 2009?

SELECT emp.FirstName, emp.LastName,
ROUND(SUM(Inv.Total), 2) as 'Total Sales' 
FROM chinook.Employees emp
JOIN chinook.Customers cust 
ON cust.SupportRepId = emp.EmployeeId
JOIN chinook.Invoices Inv 
ON Inv.CustomerId = cust.CustomerId
WHERE emp.Title = 'Sales Support Agent' 
AND Inv.InvoiceDate LIKE '2009%' 
GROUP BY emp.FirstName
ORDER BY (round(sum(Inv.Total), 2))  DESC LIMIT 1;
